The implementation is still a bit basic but it generally works pretty well.

## How can I get this?

Builds will be uploaded in the [Releases](https://github.com/Justus6568/NewPipe/releases) section. Please download the APK from the newest release and install it on your device.

## Why isn't this in upstream NewPipe?
[The developer team](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe) behind the official NewPipe decided that they do not want to include these kinds of functionality in their app. See https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/pinned/newpipe-and-online-advertising/, https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3205, and https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/7469 for more information and discussion.

We obviously disagree but we respect their decision and continue to offer SponsorBlock and Return YouTube Dislike in NewPipe via this fork.

## Bugs
Please do not report bugs encountered while using this fork to the upstream developers.
